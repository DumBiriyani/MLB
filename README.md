Predicting stadium attendance for major league baseball

* Identified factors driving stadium attendance and developed dynamic prediction model using ensemble and sequential modeling to forecast attendance with 28% lesser MAPE than baseline.
* SARIMAX model was used to address the causality between attendance and important features (game, player, geography and economy level indicators)
* For the prediction task, various models were tried including tree based and sequuential models
* Bayesian optimization technique was used to optimize game schedule for MLB 2023
